# Application Ideas

- Write software that can take a jpeg image and turn it into the correct format for printing as a sticker
- Create a browser/phone app that will read text on a page for you
- Create a gamified assistant (clippy?) Navi that will be able to guide the user around a page in a game way
- Like Pokemon go, but collecting birds, store birds in a “garden” and you can look at them -> draw cute icons for all of the birds - leverage the bird app gabby uses
- Research https://www.andy.works/
- Investigate the terminal pets program - can I make this my own and real cute? (I want to make the cat bigger)
- Make an application that takes in a photo of you and converts it into art
