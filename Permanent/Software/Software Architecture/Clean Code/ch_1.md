# Common Clean Programming Practices

Clean code has a lot of features, not always described the same by different legendary programmers. Some common threads though, are:

- Usage of tests
- Simplicity, only one way to solve it and it's the least complex possible
- Minimizes complexity through fewer classes, methods, etc
- No code duplication
- Meaningful names
- An object or method should only do one thing
- Leave the campground cleaner than you found it
