## What it's About

A girl named Sophie is the oldest of three daughters. She believes that she is destined to failure if she were to pursue her fortune. After she runs into the Witch of the Waste, she is turned into an old woman by a spell. She cannot tell anyone about it to break the spell. She sets off on her own after this, and runs into Howl's castle, where she meets the fire demon Calcifer. Calcifer is also under a spell, and so they make a pact to help each other. 

## How I discovered it?

From the film "Howl's Moving Castle" by Studio Ghibli, directed by Hayao Miyazaki.

## General Thoughts

I truly adore this book and movie. So many parts of the animation were taken directly from the book, it's astonishing how much life and character was truly in the original by Dianne Wynn Jones.

## Who Would Like it?

Anyone who is interested in fantasy or a fan of the movie. The book is probably best for younger women, as it is somewhat a coming of age novel.
