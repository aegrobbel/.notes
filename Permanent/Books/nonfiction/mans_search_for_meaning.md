## The Book in Three Sentences

This book is broken into two parts, the first being Viktor Frankl's account of his time in Auschwitz, the Nazi concentration camp, and the second being his discussion of Logotherapy. Frankl uses his experience to describe human behavior, and his theory of Logotherapy, which states that people seek meaning in life above all else. His honest depiction of life in a concentration camp, subsequent departure, and emotional anguish all contribute to an extremely powerful emotional experience while reading this book.

## Impressions

This is an important book to read in order to better understand the reality of Auschwitz and the horrors that occurred in concentration camps. The former section is in particular more impactful, whereas the latter is focused on describing Logotherapy. The basic principles of Logotherapy are as follows: 

- Every moment of life has meaning, regardless of the circumstances
- Humans' main motivation in life is to find meaning
- Ways to find meaning are through, as he puts "by creating a work or doing a deed", "by experiencing something or encountering someone", and "by the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering".

He goes on to describe that while everything physical, even emotional through loved ones, can be taken from a man, that man's attitude about the circumstances themselves cannot be taken.

I am slightly skeptical of Logotherapy in terms of truly being able to take on any attitude of ones choosing. I personally believe there may be more nuanced things going on here. Why can't I tell myself right now to believe that my past traumas were not so bad? In addition, it was interesting to read his criticisms, namely the correlation he points to that people who emotionally withdrew and gave up also ended up physically deteriorating and dying. It is argued that data does not support this claim, however, it does fall in line with his psychological theory. 

## Who Should Read It?

Everyone should read this book (at least the first part) at least once. It is always impactful to remind oneself of historical truths and what those before us had encountered. In addition, even if you don't necessarily subscribe to all parts of Logotherapy, his idea that attitude can vastly improve even the worst circumstances is helpful in terms of recontextualizing one's autonomy in situations, particularly the ones we wish didn't happen.

## How the Book Changed Me

While I'm still digesting the concepts within this book and will probably never fully come to a conclusion about our true goal in life as humans, the search for meaning is highly relatable for me. In addition, the concepts he describes do help me feel a greater level of autonomy in all situations, I currently have the power to decide how I feel about a situation, and within that is power. Also, the way he describes one can derive meaning encapsulates something that I've observed, which is the workaholic and the family-driven person, or the experience driven person who is always exploring, all these archetypes seem to be encapsulated within his definition of deriving meaning. 

## My Top Three Quotes

1. When a man finds that it is his destiny to suffer, he will have to accept his suffering as his task; his single and unique task. He will have to acknowledge the fact that even in suffering he is unique and alone in the universe. No one can relieve him of his suffering or suffer in his place. His unique opportunity lies in the way in which he bears his burden.
2. What man actually needs is not a tensionless state but rather the striving and struggling for a worthwhile goal, a freely chosen task.
3. Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual
4. (Bonus quote!) Don't aim at success- the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the **unintended side-effect of one's dedication to a cause greater than oneself** or as the by-product of **one's surrender to a person other than oneself**.
