## The Book in Three Sentences

I'm Glad My Mom died is a memoir about growing up, it recounts the author Jennette McCurdy's life, from the time she first started acting, to present day. In going through the past, the author is able to share her experiences the world didn't see as a child actor, and in doing so discover the things that happened in her childhood through an adult lens. The book ends with an honest portrayal of her life and family, with it's messiness and rough edges, and a hopeful new direction (writing) for the author.

## Impressions

The book is written in short "episodes", which reflects the author's day-to-day job, and allows for a brevity that alleviates the heaviness of the subject matter. She usually ends with a funny moment that highlights the "theme" or intent of the chapter. This style of writing feels quick paced and fun to read, moving the book seemlessly through her life as she ages and encounters various obstacles and successes.

The matter-of-fact tone that the book takes also lends a certain no-nonsense honesty, as well as a dry humor that feels very genuine rather than forced. (Maybe one or two jokes felt pandering, the rest were simply matter of fact statements that provided some sort of humorous irony, or a callback to earlier). 

Also a bonus for the audio book is her endearing use of different voices for the "characters".

## Who Should Read It?

Women of all ages, as well as those who grew up watching Jennette might find value in this book.

## How the Book Changed Me

This book helped me to re-examine areas of my own life that I might be lying to myself about. I found her passages on making other people happy early in life, combined with her struggle with food, to be relatable. 

The book also calls into question our true responsibility toward our mothers and motherhood in general. Without explicitly saying it, she asks, do I really have to respect this person who has hurt me and abused me in so many ways? If my family is so difficult, do I really have to continue my relationship with them? At the end of the book, she leaves her mother's grave for the last time, but not without critizing the slew of positive adjectives her family used to glorify her dead mother. She doesn't seem entirely at peace with the situation, but it feels like an appropriate depiction of the universal conflict we all face within our strongest relationships.
