## The Book in Three Sentences

This book is a memoir that centers on the chaotic, eccentric, dangerous, and somewhat precious ethos of Tamara's youth in New York. The author immerses the reader in the lifestyle and philosophy of her parents, specifically her father and his friend Willy, through the many stories she shares. By the end of the book, the reader is meant to feel the same regret and loss that the author likely faces given the current circumstances of her original home, missing a certain character that most readers have likely never witnessed before, yet yearn for all the same.

## Impressions

"This book captures not just a lost New York but a whole lost way of life." The book begins and ends with the idea of arbitrary goals, specifically a family going on a vacation solely due to their surname. Tamara uses this story to illustrate her most important point - namely, that the ASG is a way to not only get through but enjoy life. The stories are formatted to not always extend down the page, as well as include images and illustrations. The sentiment feels more like a collection of memories strung together, rather than one cohesive tale, sort of remniscent of how one might recall their own childhood, in bits and pieces and out of order. I found this book in general quite fun to read as well as fit into my current image and narrative of New York City, like an additional puzzle piece that sort of throws everything into a greater perspective.

## Who Should Read It?

Potential readers might be anyone who is interested in New York, particularly in the near-historical sense, as well as anyone who might enjoy a light memoir that is mostly charming and wholesome. The book itself is quite fast to read, and shares with the reader a very specific wisdom that auther herself feels is integral to her upbringing and important enough to share with the world - the ASG.

## How the Book Changed Me

The book begins and ends with describing the philosophy behind the ASG. I read this book specifically because of this sentiment to be honest, because for most of my life I've always seemed to have a "Important Serious Goal", which has brought me a lot of pain and stress, rather unproductively might I add (the worst is to be unproductive, right?) This book served as a nice reminder that I am on the right track in terms of pursuing a life that is a little less serious and acknowledging that I might benefit from making more arbitrary, stupid goals.

## My Top Three Quotes

1. A goal that isn’t too important makes you live in the moment, and still gives you a driving force. This driving force is a way to get around the fact that we will all die and there is no real point to life. But with the ASG there is a point. It is not such an important point that you postpone joy to achieve it. It is just a decoy point that keeps you bobbing along, allowing you to find ecstasy in the small things, the unexpected, and the everyday.
2. What happens when you reach the stupid goal? Then what? You just find a new ASG.
3. “There are roughly three New Yorks,” E.B. White once wrote. “There is, first, the New York of the man or woman who was born here, who takes the city for granted and accepts its size and its turbulence as natural and inevitable. Second, there is the New York of the commuter—the city that is devoured by locusts each day and spat out each night. Third, there is the New York of the person who was born somewhere else and came to New York in quest of something.”
