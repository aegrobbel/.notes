# Stop for big moments!

We want to basically stop action before important moments (like a punch).

We also have a concept of "boss stop", where you stop the action and show the crumbling/defeat of the boss but you can't move the player at all. When you defeat a boss, the screen stops and flashes for a moment. This is important, so that the player can properly feel and process the importance of the impact. We also stop action when the player dies (example is kirby loses a life).

We want to avoid an instance where the player is wondering what happened, this is mostly why we want to stop everything, to accentuate something that has happened. 

We can also do things/effects like shaking the screen, and turning the movement into slow motion after the impact or big moment.
