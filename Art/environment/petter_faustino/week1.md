# Week 1 Class Notes

- Shape design keeps things organized, especially in bigger paintings.
- It's also very helpful to simplify things, and build up from basic shapes.
- Creating big shape shadows removes the need for drawing/illustration in the image (also saves time, and helps us think about the shape design)

This class is a bit of a survey of all the topics.

- We have a concept of a pinch shadow, vs form shadows that indicate angles, etc, and also thrown shadows. 
- Lasso in one big silhouette
- Givei t big shadows (carving/sculpting the subject)
