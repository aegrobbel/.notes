# Risk and Reward

Game essence can be described as all the things that make a game fun. 

Masahiro describes this as "push and pull" or "risk and reward".
In the most simple example, we have something like space invaders, where the only way to access the "reward", ie killing the alien, is to invite some risk to the player, by putting yourself in the path of the alien's shots.

Game mechanics that __vary__ risk contribute to game essence. So, using the example of space invaders, the width of the player "cannon", and being able to hide halfway under a bunker while still shooting.
