Respect all people, things, everything in life that you come into contact with, as well as yourself.
Help others and give everyone the benefit of the doubt.
Take pleasure in hard work and the less exciting parts of life.
Live in the present.
Be honest and maintain integrity.
Stop lying to yourself.
Take care of yourself like a friend or child.
Behave according to your heart, not what you think others will say or think of you.
Not all problems can be solved with thought.
Listen and sit with discomfort, instead of covering it up.
Don't make decisions in strong emotional states.
