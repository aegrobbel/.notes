Hi, I am really sorry to say this but I 
have decided to leave the company, with my 
last day being at or around the 11th of October.
I really value my time spent here so far and 
everything you all have done, but I don't think
this role is right for me, and I don't believe 
I have what the company is looking for in order
 to be effective.

My reasons are primarily personal, I have been 
struggling with life changes, working from home
 every day, and the workload of learning everything to become effective here. I realized it's no longer productive for the company or me to continue in this way.

I am going to take some time to reassess what I am looking for in a job, and may consider trying out a different industry. Again, I really feel terrible for leaving so soon, and all of the effort and resources it took to get here, and I want to appreciate that.

Would you be able to give me a list of people who I should talk to regarding this? As well as any other documents I might need to work through
